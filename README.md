#EVCN

To create a site that calls on the google Maps API and or Google Places API to allow users to locate services in their immediate
area.

I have created a site that allows users to locate Electric Vehicle charging stations at their current location without having to input a search.

##UX

my site is aimed at anyone looking to own or already owns an electric vehicle and would like to know all the available services
where they are, from public charging networks to private charging station. the site not only shows both but also allows the user to add their own to the network via email.

As a user type, I want to see charging stations near me, so that i can

##Features

The site is one page broken up into three main sections, about EVCN Map and contact us

EVCN is an super easy to use webpage, it’s designed for all ages .

###Features Left to Implement
_. info window
In future I would like to implement a popup info window for every marker of the search results to show the name address and type of charging station.  
_. side panel with brief description
The side panel will display name address type of charging station number of chargers, avaiablitiy of chargers and a rating of the station. A get direction with way points button.
\*. Members sign in section
I would also like to add a sign up and login button that would give members access to a list of privately owed chargers that the members could use when they are available.
